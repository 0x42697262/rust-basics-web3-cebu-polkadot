### 2. Setting Up Rust Development Environment

To get started with Rust development, you need to set up your development environment. Follow the instructions below based on your operating system:

#### Linux

1. **Installing Rust:**
   - Open a terminal.
   - Run the following command to install Rust using Rustup, the official installer for Rust:
     ```sh
     curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to complete the installation process.

2. **Choosing a Text Editor or IDE:**
   - Popular choices for Rust development on Linux include Visual Studio Code, Vim, Emacs, and Sublime Text.
   - Install your preferred text editor or IDE using your distribution's package manager or by downloading it from the official website.

3. **Configuring Environment Variables:**
   - Rust environment variables are automatically configured during installation. If you encounter any issues, ensure that the following paths are included in your `PATH` environment variable:
     - `$HOME/.cargo/bin`
     - `/usr/local/cargo/bin` (if installed system-wide)

4. **Managing Rust Projects with Cargo:**
   - Cargo is the official package manager and build system for Rust.
   - Create a new Rust project by running the following command in your terminal:
     ```sh
     cargo new my_project
     ```
   - Navigate to your project directory and start coding!

5. **Testing Your Rust Installation:**
   - To verify that Rust and Cargo are installed correctly, run the following commands in your terminal:
     ```sh
     rustc --version
     cargo --version
     ```
   - You should see the versions of Rust and Cargo installed on your system.

#### Windows

1. **Installing Rust:**
   - Download the Rustup installer from the official website: [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
   - Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation process.

2. **Choosing a Text Editor or IDE:**
   - Popular choices for Rust development on Windows include Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Sublime Text.
   - Install your preferred text editor or IDE by downloading it from the official website.

3. **Configuring Environment Variables:**
   - Rust environment variables are automatically configured during installation. If you encounter any issues, ensure that the following paths are included in your system's `PATH` environment variable:
     - `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin`
     - `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\cargo\bin` (if installed system-wide)

4. **Managing Rust Projects with Cargo:**
   - Follow the same steps as outlined for Linux to create and manage Rust projects using Cargo.

5. **Testing Your Rust Installation:**
   - Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell window.
   - Run the following commands to verify that Rust and Cargo are installed correctly:
     ```cmd
     rustc --version
     cargo --version
     ```
   - You should see the versions of Rust and Cargo installed on your system.

#### macOS

1. **Installing Rust:**
   - Open a terminal.
   - Run the following command to install Rust using Rustup:
     ```sh
     curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to complete the installation process.

2. **Choosing a Text Editor or IDE:**
   - Popular choices for Rust development on macOS include Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Sublime Text.
   - Install your preferred text editor or IDE by downloading it from the official website or using Homebrew.

3. **Configuring Environment Variables:**
   - Rust environment variables are automatically configured during installation. If you encounter any issues, ensure that the following paths are included in your `PATH` environment variable:
     - `$HOME/.cargo/bin`

4. **Managing Rust Projects with Cargo:**
   - Follow the same steps as outlined for Linux to create and manage Rust projects using Cargo.

5. **Testing Your Rust Installation:**
   - Open a terminal.
   - Run the following commands to verify that Rust and Cargo are installed correctly:
     ```sh
     rustc --version
     cargo --version
     ```
   - You should see the versions of Rust and Cargo installed on your system.



### Additional Suggestions:
For IDE, Visual Studio Code is preferred due to its excellent Rust support.
Install the `Rust Extension Pack by Swellaby` in Visual Studio Code, which includes:
- `Rust Analyser`: Provides code analysis, completion, and navigation features.
- `Even Better Toml`: Enhances support for TOML files commonly used in Rust projects.
- `crates`: Simplifies managing Rust dependencies within Visual Studio Code.
