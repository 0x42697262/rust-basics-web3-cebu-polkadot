### 1. Using Standard io module:

To use `io` to take input from the user in Rust, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the standard input/output module by adding `use std::io;` at the beginning of your code.
2. Inside the `main` function, declare a mutable string variable to store the user input, like `let mut input = String::new();`.
3. Prompt the user to input something using `println!("Enter something:");`.
4. Use a `match` statement with `io::stdin().read_line(&mut input)` to read the user input. This function reads a line from the standard input and appends it to the input string.
5. Handle the result of the `match` statement to differentiate between success and error cases. If successful, you can print the input, and if there's an error, you can handle it accordingly.

Here is a simplified example of how to achieve this:

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();

    println!("Enter something:");

    match io::stdin().read_line(&mut input) {
        Ok(_) => {
            println!("You entered: {}", input);
        },
        Err(e) => {
            println!("Error: {}", e);
        }
    }
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to use `io` to take input from the user in Rust.


### 2. Using Crates text_io library:
To take user input in Rust using the `text_io` crate, you can follow the example provided in the search results[1]. The following steps demonstrate how to use the `text_io` crate to take user input:

1. Add the `text_io` crate to your `Cargo.toml` file:
```toml
[dependencies]
text_io = "0.1.8"
```

2. In your Rust source code, import the `text_io` crate and use it to take user input:
```rust
use text_io::read;

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    read!(&mut input);
    println!("You entered: {}", input);
}
```

In this example, the `read!` macro is used to read a line of input from the user and store it in the `input` variable. The `println!` macro is then used to print the entered input to the console.

Note that the `text_io` crate provides a more concise and user-friendly way to take user input compared to the standard library's `std::io` module. However, it is not included in the standard library and needs to be added as a dependency in your project.
