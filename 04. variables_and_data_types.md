### 4. Variables and Data Types

#### Declaring Variables in Rust

In Rust, variables are declared using the `let` keyword followed by the variable name and optional type annotation. Here's how you declare variables in Rust:

```rust
let x: i32 = 10;
let y = 3.14;
```

#### Mutable vs Immutable Variables

Rust distinguishes between mutable and immutable variables. By default, variables are immutable. You can make a variable mutable by using the `mut` keyword. Here's an example:

```rust
let mut counter = 0;
counter += 1; // This is allowed because counter is mutable
```

#### Primitive Data Types

Rust has several primitive data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and characters.

- **Integer:** Represents whole numbers and can be signed or unsigned. Example: `i32`, `u64`.
- **Floating-Point:** Represents numbers with a fractional part. Example: `f32`, `f64`.
- **Boolean:** Represents true or false values. Example: `bool`.
- **Character:** Represents a single Unicode character. Example: `char`.

#### Compound Data Types: Tuple and Array

Rust also provides compound data types like tuples and arrays.

- **Tuple:** A fixed-size collection of heterogeneous elements. Example: `(1, "hello", true)`.
- **Array:** A fixed-size collection of homogeneous elements. Example: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

##### Tuple

A tuple is a fixed-size collection of heterogeneous elements. Each element in the tuple can have a different type. Tuples are useful when you want to group together multiple values of different types.

```rust
let person: (i32, &str, bool) = (25, "John", true);
```

Accessing elements of a tuple can be done using indexing:

```rust
let age = person.0;      // Access the first element (age)
let name = person.1;     // Access the second element (name)
let is_adult = person.2; // Access the third element (is_adult)
```

##### Array

An array is a fixed-size collection of homogeneous elements. All elements in an array must have the same type. Arrays are useful when you need a collection of items that have a consistent type and size.

```rust
let numbers: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

Accessing elements of an array can also be done using indexing:

```rust
let first_number = numbers[0]; // Access the first element
let second_number = numbers[1]; // Access the second element
```

#### Type Inference in Rust

Rust supports type inference, allowing the compiler to deduce the types of variables based on their usage. This reduces the need for explicit type annotations.

```rust
let x = 42; // Rust infers that x has type i32
```

#### Constants vs Variables

Constants are similar to variables, but their values cannot be changed once set. They are declared using the `const` keyword and must be annotated with a type.

```rust
const PI: f64 = 3.14;
```

#### Best Practices

- Prefer immutable variables by default and only use mutable variables when necessary to minimize unexpected changes in your code.
- Use descriptive variable names to make your code self-explanatory and easier to understand.
- When choosing between different data types, consider the range of values you need to represent and the precision required.

#### Real-World Example

Imagine you're developing a weather application in Rust. You use immutable variables to store temperature readings and mutable variables to track changes in weather conditions throughout the day.

#### Conclusion

Understanding variables and data types is fundamental to writing Rust programs. By mastering these concepts, you'll be well-equipped to tackle more complex programming tasks with confidence.
