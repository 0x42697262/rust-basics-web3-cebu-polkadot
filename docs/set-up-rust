# How to Download and Install Rust

## For macOS

1. **Open Terminal**:
   - You can find Terminal in Applications > Utilities or search for it using Spotlight (Cmd + Space, then type "Terminal").

2. **Install Homebrew (if not already installed)**:
   - Homebrew is a package manager for macOS. If you haven't installed it, you can do so by pasting the following command in the Terminal:
     ```bash
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     ```
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

3. **Install Rust Using Homebrew**:
   - Once Homebrew is installed, run the following command to install Rust:
     ```bash
     brew install rust
     ```

4. **Verify the Installation**:
   - After installation, check that Rust is installed correctly by running:
     ```bash
     rustc --version
     ```
   - You should see the version of Rust that you installed.

## For Windows

1. **Open Command Prompt or PowerShell**:
   - You can open Command Prompt by searching for "cmd" in the Start menu or PowerShell by searching for "PowerShell".

2. **Download the Rust Installer**:
   - You can download the Rust installation script by running the following command:
     ```powershell
     curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
     ```
   - If `curl` is not available, you can manually download the installer from [Rust's official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

3. **Run the Rust Installer**:
   - If you downloaded the installer manually, navigate to your Downloads folder and run the installer executable.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

4. **Configure Your PATH**:
   - The installer should automatically add Rust to your system PATH. If it doesnâ€™t, you can do this manually:
     - Search for "Environment Variables" in the Start menu.
     - Under "System Properties," click on "Environment Variables."
     - In the "System variables" section, find the `Path` variable and edit it to include the path to your Rust installation (usually located at `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.cargo\bin`).

5. **Verify the Installation**:
   - Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window and run:
     ```powershell
     rustc --version
     ```
   - You should see the version of Rust that you installed.

## Conclusion

That's it! You have successfully downloaded and installed Rust on both macOS and Windows. If you need to update Rust in the future, you can run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
rustup update
